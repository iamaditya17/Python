About Python:
-------------
-> Python is High Level Language (HLL) which is not understand by the machine.
Machine understand only binary (0,1).
-> So python uses Interpreter to convert the HLL into Machine Level Language (MLL).
-> It is free and open-source.
-> It is simple and easy
-> It maintains case sensitive

Print():
--------
-> print() is a function which is used to print on the display.

Data Types:
-----------
Integer (1,2,-1,-2,0)
String  ('Aditya', "Aditya", '''Aditya''')
Float    (1.05,-2.06)
Boolean  (True, False)
None       (a = None)

Comments
---------
-> Single line comment : #
-> Multiline comment : """   """

Operators
---------

1. Arithmetic operators: +,-,*,/,%,**
2. Relational / Comparison Operators: ==,!=,<,>,<=,>=
3. Assignment Operators: =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,**=
4. Logical Operators: not,and,or

Type Conversion:
----------------
-> Python will do this automatically

e.g: adding a Int variable with Float variable which will return a Float o/p.

Type Casting:
-------------
-> It was done forcefully

User Input using input():
-------------------------
-> By default input() takes the input as a String

e.g: 
value = input("Enter a number: ")
print(type(value))  -->O/P: <class 'str'>

Conditional statements:
-----------------------
if-else
if-elif-else
nested-if

Lists in python
---------------
-> It is a built in data type that stores set of values
-> In python lists are equivalent to arrays.
-> But array store values with same data types but lists can store values of different data types.

marks = [80,90,100]
students = ["Aditya",90,"BBSR"]

Strings are immutable (non-changable) in python but lists are mutable(changable).

Tuples
------
In python Tuples are built-in data types that lets us create immutable sequences of values.

e.g : marks = (10,20,30)
      marks[0] = 5   --> this is not allowed in tuple


Dictionary
----------
-> Dictionaries are used to store data in key:value pairs.
-> They are unordered, mutable(changeable) and don't allow duplicate keys.
-> The "Keys" of a disctionary can be of any type except list and dictionary.

Set
-----
-> Set is a collection of unordered items.
-> Set is mutable but the elements of set are immutable.
-> Each element in the set must be unique and immutable.
-> If a set contains repeated elements then it stored only once (doesn't allow duplicates).
-> List and dictionary can't be stored inside set.
